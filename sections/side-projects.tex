\cvskill
{RISC processor}
{Designed a 5-stage pipelined MIPS-based processor supporting 
branch prediction, operand forwarding\linebreak and containing high-performance 
components, such as a sparse tree adder and a booth multiplier.}

\cvskill
{LDPC simulator}
{Developed a C++ 
{\color{myblue}\href{https://github.com/djah/LDPC_simulator}{\textbf{simulator}}}
for algorithms that make use of Low Density Parity Check~(LDPC) codes, 
whi-\linebreak -ch are used for fast data error detection/correction in modern 
flash memories.}
